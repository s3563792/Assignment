    <p> some basic background</p>
    <p> I am a internation student, I come from China and I study in RMIT unveristy. This is my second year of undergraduate. My degree is Bachelor of Business(Information Systems).

    <h2>Interest in IT </h2>
    <p> Like what I said, I love video games and I’m very interest in game development and game design.
When I realized that people could program games, I became interested in IT, because I really want to be involved in game creation and create video game like League of Legends. I know if I want to  be involved in game creation, I have to learn about Information technology and understanding basic programming languages. For now, I know a bit of programming languages, like the use of HTML and CSS, and tried to do some basic programming, I still have a lot to learn.</p>

<p>I study in RMIT unversity, because I like RMIT’s learning environment, there are many modern buildings and high quality of teaching. And I think it suit me very well. RMIT is a very famous university, it is one of the most famous universities in Australia. I knew about it when I was a high school student in China. And its graduates employment rate is very high, so I choose to come to RMIT.</p>

<p>I expect to learn programming language skills and understand information technology like what the origin and application of information technology, and can use better help for future work. Also I want to try to do some basic website or software according to what programming language skills I have. And I can get some experience from it. It would be better to know some friends who also like IT and programming.</p>

  <p>Employers use these tests (like Myers-Briggs test) to see what kind of position and workplace environment employees are suitable for, so that they can be placed in the most suitable position. These test results can assess employees' skills, teamwork and problem-solving skills, and even some difficulties, like communication(Cynthia Vinney 2019). </p>
  <p>So I think these results can help me better understand my position in the workplace, understand my own disadvantages, and find teammates who can make up for each other. I can clearly understand my position when I in a team and do my own work well.When forming a team, employees should be assigned to different groups according to their personalities and abilities, so as to ensure that the employees in each group have different advantages and make grouops become better and better. The advantages of these employees can be obtained through the results of those tests.</p>

  <h2>Project Ideas </h2>
  <h4>Second hand game trading platform</h4>
  <p>This is a platform specially created for the game market and it is platform for trading between players Players can buy or sell games and accounts of any game platform(Steam, Epic games, etc.) on the platform, through the gift system or other systems in the game. Even players can trade game equipment or some props through the platform. All transactions on our platform are customers to customers(players to players). It works in a similar way to Amazon, but all the products are related to the game. Players can sell any game or game props they want on the platform, and they can create their own sales page.</p>
  <p>In 2019, the global video game market will be US $151.06 billion, with a Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) of 12.9% from 2020 to 2027. Video games will maintain an optimistic market growth prospect in the next few years(Market Analysis Report 2020). This means that players will spend more on the game. However, not all game consumption is correct for players. Many players buy new games or game props, but if they are not satisfied with them, they can only idle in their own virtual warehouse. But our platform can provide channels for this type of players to sell games or props they don't need. They can sell their goods at a lower price, similar to second-hand transactions. For game players, the second-hand transaction of games or props will not have any impact on them. Therefore, for the players who buy games, they can buy their favorite games or props at a low price, which is a discount for them, and the discount has no term.
</p>
  <p>My project idea is about second hand game trading platform, it is a customized platform for players. Players can sell any game related products on the platform, and can create their own game stores to sell games or game props that they own and don't want to play or have played for a long time, through the sales account number or the gift system in the game. The platform is registered under the real name system, and all players trading on the platform need to bind their own personal information and corresponding game accounts(it can be multiple). This can increase the trust in transactions between players. The trading mode is that when a player sees the goods sold by a player, he can pay to the platform, and the platform will remind the player who sells the goods. When the player presents or transfers the goods through other games, the system will receive a prompt and automatically send the payment into the player's account. Otherwise, if the player fails to transfer the goods in time(like within a day), the payment will be cancelled and automatically returned Previous account. For example, there's a game on Steam called Counter-Strike Global Offensive, players can won randomly draw different types of weapon skin in prize draw in the game. But prizes can be repeated, and some players will draw the same weapon skin, so they can trade weapon skins they don't need with other players. However, the official trading platform not only raises the price very high, but also the players need to pay a lot for the official platform to buy and sell, so that no player will choose to buy some weapons skin which is not very rare and expensive in official trading platform, because that is not worth. This also leads to players drawing the same prize, they can only leave the game props idle in the virtual game warehouse. In my second hand game trading platform, all transactions are executed by players, who can determine the market price of these games or game products. They can communicate with each other and use the platform for free, like sellers want to attract buyers, they have to lower the price, because in the game market, there is no good or bad quality, same products are the same code from a game. Players can buy the same game at a lower price, this will promote a virtuous circle in the market and ensure that prices will not be driven up. So the purpose of my platform is to let players play more games and experience more games with less consumption. </p>
  <p>Because my project idea is software is an online trading platform, and the platform is only used to trade games and game props, that are all virtual products. And transactions are done through in-game systems, not platforms, I just need to make a trading platform software or website, and a database is also needed to record the information of each registered user, including personal information and game account information. Also need network security equipment, can eliminate network failure, maintenance and maintenance of website security, protect user information. The software need a system that can connect the platform and each game to ensure the information delivery between each other.</p>
  <p>In terms of skill requirements, it is necessary to master and skillfully use programming, like HTML lightweight language code editing, to be able to design web page effects, to use the DW tool, cut out the PS web page effect using the CSS style, etc. And if I want to create a trading website, I have to register your domain name, virtual host, website building system, website template and management background, etc.</p>
  <p>If the second hand game trading platform is successful, players will greatly reduce the cost of the game, and even earn a lot of income by selling game props or some types of games and players get more experience with less consumption. Also trading through formal platforms allows players to purchase or sell with confidence. Previous players because of the official platform bid up prices and transaction fees, leading them to choose idle goods they do not need. But through this platform, players will not have these worries, they can freely choose to sell any product about the game, and use the platform for free. Sellers attract players by lowering the price of goods and players can buy the same game at a lower price, this will promote a virtuous circle in the market which will promote the development of the video game market, so that more people are attracted by cheap and excellent games to participate in the game industry.</p>
